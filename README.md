# 🏆 Challenge 15 - “Jingle All The Way” 🎅

Every year on the 24th December, Santa faces the busiest evening of the year as he sets out on a mission to deliver gifts to every corner of the world. Obviously, Santa visits every household in every country, but a slightly more compressed itinerary of his route [has been provided here](https://pastebin.com/RWx85VaS) along with his expected time of arrival in each location (in GMT). Your task is to write an algorithm capable of returning the time remaining until his next destination at any given time during the evening. The use of time/date libraries is allowed.

## Rewards:

3️⃣ Points are awarded for a working algorithm

2️⃣ Further points are awarded for providing a suitable set of unit tests

5️⃣ Further points are awarded for displaying a map of Santa's route, along with his current approximate location for any given time during the evening

## Example:

Given an input time of Sun Dec 25 2022 02:20:00 GMT+0000, a simple algorithm might return:

```
Arriving in Reykjavík in 10 minutes
```
